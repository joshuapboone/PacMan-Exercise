# PacMan Exercise
<img src='PacMan1.png'>

In this exercise I built a simulation of the PacMan game.  I created a PacMan that opens and closes its mouth as it crosses the screen.  I also had the PacMan detect when it touches the left or right side of the webpage and it reverses its direction.  I also used the JavaScript function setTimeout to automate the movement.

How to run: Download a master file of this repository to your computer, which will be a zip file.  Extract files from the zip file.  Click on the index.html file and you will be brought to a webpage.  Click on the PacMan and watch it move across the screen.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future I would like to include another object on the screen and have the PacMan eat the object and have the object disappear.
