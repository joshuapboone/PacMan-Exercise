# PacMan Exercise
<img src='PacMan1.png'>

In this exercise I built a simulation of the PacMan game.  I created a PacMan that opens and closes its mouth as it crosses the screen.  I also had the PacMan detect when it touches the left or right side of the WebPage and it reverses its direction.  I also used the JavaScript function setTimeout to automate the movement.
